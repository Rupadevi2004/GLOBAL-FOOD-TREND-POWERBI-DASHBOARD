The project also explored the production volumes of apples, avocados, bananas, and oranges by different regions, identifying Europe and Asia as significant contributors. Maize production demonstrated consistent growth, particularly from the late 1980s onward. The study further indicated that grapes had the highest total production among fruits at 43 billion tonnes, followed by apples, bananas, and oranges. This comprehensive analysis equips ABC Company with valuable insights to better understand global food production trends, aiding strategic decision-making in the agricultural sector.
